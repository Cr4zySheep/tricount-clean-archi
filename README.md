# Tricount using Clean Architecture

## Backend

Technologies:

* Typescript
* Node v18
* [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)
* Fastify server (Soonâ„¢)

### Get started

To share the same configuration, you can open the following workspace with VSCode `.vscode/tricount.code-workspace`, it should open the project!

**Note:** You should see two root folders in the explorer `tricount` (project root folder) and `backend` (backend root folder). This way, we can share the same configuration for multiple services, but still enjoy VSCode power in each sub-project (for example auto-format, debugging, etc.).

1. Make sure you are using node v18
2. Go into the `backend` directory
3. Install the dependancies with `npm i`
4. You can run the project with `npm start` or you can run the test with `npm test`
